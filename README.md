Cosmic-Velocity-Calculator

A small fun project to calculate the first and second cosmic velocities according to the mass of a space object. Practice Cpp;
For configuration I use Windows Desktop Wizard because I am learning on it. Later, it will be better to use CMake;

Roadmap
Phase one: - Basic Logic(IO, algorthms(first cosmic velocity, second cosmic velocity -> for smaller objects) show results);
Phase two: - add GUI(Qt), add graphs diagrams, unit selection;
Phase three: -  add(third and forth cosmic velocity) export data;
phase fourth: - add space objects (comets etc);
I will definitely edit the roadmap as needed in the future;
Have a great day hihi;
