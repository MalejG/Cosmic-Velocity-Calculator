# Cosmic Velocity Calculator

A small project to calculate the first, second and third cosmic velocity according to the mass of a space objects.


## Roadmap
* ✔ - Basic Logic(IO, algorthms(first cosmic velocity, second cosmic velocity -> for smaller objects) show results);
* ✔ - add GUI(Qt);
* ✔ -  add(third cosmic velocity);
*  - export data;
*  - Add description and finish;
