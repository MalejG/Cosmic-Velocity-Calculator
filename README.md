# Cosmic Velocity Calculator

A small fun project to calculate the first and second cosmic velocities according to the mass of a space object. Practice Cpp;
For configuration I use Windows Desktop Wizard because I am learning on it. Later, it will be better to use CMake;

## Roadmap
* ✔ Phase one: - Basic Logic(IO, algorthms(first cosmic velocity, second cosmic velocity -> for smaller objects) show results);
* ✔ Phase two: - add GUI(Qt);
* Phase three: -  add(third cosmic velocity) export data, unit selection;
## Have a great day;
