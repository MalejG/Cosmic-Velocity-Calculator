# Cosmic Velocity Calculator

A small fun project to calculate the first and second cosmic velocities according to the mass of a space object. Practice Cpp;
For configuration I use Windows Desktop Wizard because I am learning on it. Later, it will be better to use CMake;

## Roadmap
* ✔ - Basic Logic(IO, algorthms(first cosmic velocity, second cosmic velocity -> for smaller objects) show results);
* ✔ - add GUI(Qt);
* ✔ -  add(third cosmic velocity);
*  - export data;
*  - Add description and finish;
## Have a great day;
